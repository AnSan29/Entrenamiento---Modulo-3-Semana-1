## 📝 Description of operation

The project has a form that asks for two pieces of information:

- User name
- User age

Clicking the "Send" button executes a JavaScript function that:

1. **Avoid traditional form submission** (`e.preventDefault()`).

2. **Takes the values entereds** in the name and age fields.

3. **Evaluate the age entered**:
    - If they are under 18, a motivational message for minors is displayed. 
    - If it is greater than or equal to 18, an adult message is displayed. 
    - If there is an error in the age (e.g. empty or invalid field), an alert message is displayed.


The message is dynamically displayed inside a '<span>'with the ID 'response'.
