## Description of operation

The project has a form that asks for two pieces of information:

Clicking the "Send" button executes a JavaScript function that:

1. Avoid traditional form submission (`e.preventDefault()`).

2. Takes the values entereds in the name and age fields.

3. Evaluate the age entered:
    - If they are under 18, a motivational message for minors is displayed. 
    - If it is greater than or equal to 18, an adult message is displayed. 
    - If there is an error in the age (e.g. empty or invalid field), an alert 
    message is displayed.
    - If age entered is a negative number send a message error.


The message is dynamically displayed inside a < span > with the ID 'response'.
